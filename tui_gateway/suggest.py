"""Deterministic composer ghost-suggestion extractor (slice 1).

Given the assistant's final message text, propose up to three likely user
replies for the empty composer. Pure text analysis: no I/O, no config, no
model calls. Served over the ``complete.suggest`` RPC and rendered as ghost
text by the web and Ink composers; the renderer consumes the first
candidate, the rest are ranked spares for a future cycling UX.

Heuristics, in rank order:

- ``path``  — file paths the message talks about (outside code fences),
  most recently mentioned first. Fenced code is stripped first: a path in a
  command the user was told to RUN is not reply material.
- ``option`` — a trailing numbered list under a question ("Which
  approach?\\n1. ...\\n2. ...") yields the first two option texts.
- ``confirm`` — an approval-shaped closing question ("Want me to ...?",
  "Does that look right?") yields "Yes, go ahead".

No suggestion is a normal outcome: anything that does not end in an ask
returns an empty list, and the composer simply stays empty.
